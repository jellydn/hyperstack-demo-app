# Bin

This is the place where you'd put production-like scripts, as well as use the single entry point for your operation of the framework:

```
$ bin/hyperstack --help
```

Additionally, it's healthy to automate manual work with ad-hoc scripts, see [example.report](example.report) and [example.weekly](example.weekly) which you can rig to `cron`, a CI server, or other ways of running automatic jobs
